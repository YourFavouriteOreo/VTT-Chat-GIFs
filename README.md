# Current Features

# Pre Template Development Instructions
You will need to provide to provide a giphy api key that you will insert in the **giphySearchBar.ts** that will be used for your testing purposes which you can get from [Giphy Developers site](https://developers.giphy.com/)

# Development Instructions From the Template:
About Bundler:  
This project uses webpack to bundle your files. What this means is that every script file in src/ will get 'bundled' into one output .js file in dist/.
Likewise every static file (.html, .json, etc.) in static/ will get moved to dist.  
Because of this you should NOT have your development working directory inside the foundryuser folder. Instead you should follow the instructions below
for setting up symantic links between the dist/ folder and foundryuser.


- Run npm install
- Rename module.ts to your chosen module name.
- Rename the references to module.ts in webpack.config.js file. (Line 26)
- Fill in module.json with actual information.
- run: npm run build  
- Create a symantic link between the dist/ folder to a module folder in FoundryUser/Data/modules/[MODULE_NAME]  
--	Instructions (for windows) 
--	Open a command prompt and navigate to FoundryUser/Data/modules   
--	Run: mklink /D MODULE_NAME [DEVELOPMENT_PATH]/dist  

A note on typescript, it is completely optional and if you do not wish to use then rename any .ts files and their references to .js.
